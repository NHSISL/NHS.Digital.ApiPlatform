# Copilot Instructions

## Code Style Rules

### Line Length

- All `.cs` source files must adhere to the following rule:
  - No line of code should exceed **120 characters** in length.
  - This includes comments, string literals, and code.
  - Exception: automatically generated files may be ignored if they cannot be reformatted safely.
- **How to measure (raw file characters, per-line only):**
  - Count based on **raw file characters**, not editor rendering.
  - **Tabs count as 4 characters** for measurement.
  - Trailing whitespace must be removed.
  - **Per-physical-line measurement ONLY.** The unit of measurement is a **single newline-delimited line**.
    - **Never** add or aggregate the lengths of multiple lines.
    - A wrapped invocation is compliant if **each** physical line is ≤ 120 characters.
  - Ignore soft wrapping (on-screen wrapping that doesn't insert a newline).

### Code Formatting

- Single-line instructions must follow each other with **no blank lines** in between.
- **New rule (clarified):** A multi-line instruction must be preceded by **exactly one blank line _only when it begins a new statement_**.
  Do **not** require a blank line before a multi-line **continuation** of an existing statement.
- If a multi-line instruction is followed by further instructions, it must also be followed by **exactly one blank line**.
- **Exception (block first statement):** If a statement is the **first statement inside a block**—i.e., directly after `{`—**no preceding blank line** is required.
- Any C# `return` statement must be preceded by **exactly one blank line** unless it is the first statement in a block.
- If a constructor/method name would push a line past 120 characters, move `new`, the call, or the arguments to the next line.
- Always format so that **no single physical line exceeds 120 characters**, even when calls span multiple lines.
- **Definition of a blank line (updated):**  
  A blank line is any physical line that contains **no visible characters**. After trimming whitespace, the line must be empty.
  Lines containing only spaces or tabs **are valid blank lines**.
- **Method separation:** Method declarations must be preceded by **exactly one blank line** after the closing brace of the previous member.
- **Argument indentation:**
  - For multi-line method or constructor calls, the first line ends before the first argument.
  - Each wrapped argument line must be indented **one additional indentation level** (usually 4 spaces).
  - Do **not** use extra indentation levels.
  - The closing `)` must align with the start of the call.
- **Continuation clarification (applies across all checks):**
  - A line is considered a **continuation of the same statement** and must **not** be flagged for a missing blank line when **both** are true:
    1) The previous non-empty trimmed line **does not** end with `;` or `}`, **and**
    2) The current line, after trimming leading whitespace, **starts with a continuation indicator**, such as:
       `.`, `??`, `?`, `:`, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `&&`, `||`, `=>`, `,`, `)`, `]`,
       or any identifier/keyword when the previous line ends with an incomplete construct (e.g., open `(`, interpolated start `$"`, method/constructor call, LINQ chain).
  - Only when a **new statement** begins (i.e., the previous trimmed line **ends** with `;` or `}`) and the **next statement is multi-line** should an **exactly one** blank line be required before it.

### Enforcement

- Copilot should **not generate code** that exceeds the 120-character line limit.
- When writing new C# code, Copilot should:
  - Break up long method/constructor calls across multiple lines.
  - Use string interpolation or verbatim strings with proper line breaks where needed.
  - Format long LINQ queries across multiple lines.
  - Wrap parameters and arguments for readability.
  - Insert a blank line before any `return` following other statements.
  - Prefer moving `new` or the method invocation to the next line when appropriate.

### Review Guidelines (strict)

- Copilot must:
  - Evaluate **each physical line independently**.
  - Flag a violation only when a **single physical line** exceeds 120 characters.
  - When flagging, include line number and measured character count.
  - Suggest multiline formatting only when the offending line exceeds 120.
  - **Not** flag whitespace-only lines; they are valid blank lines.
  - **Continuation Detection (unambiguous):** Do **not** require a blank line before a line that is a continuation of the same statement.
    Treat a line as a continuation when **both** of the following hold:
      1) The previous non-empty trimmed line **does not** end with `;` or `}`, **and**
      2) The current line (after trimming leading whitespace) **begins with** a continuation indicator:
         `.`, `??`, `?`, `:`, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `&&`, `||`, `=>`, `,`, `)`, `]`,
         or any identifier/keyword when the previous line ends with an incomplete construct (e.g., open `(`, start of `$"`, method/constructor call, LINQ chain).
  - Flag missing blank lines before `return` **only** when `return` is the first token on the line **and** the previous non-empty trimmed line ended with `;` or `}`.
- **Operator lines:**
  - Measure compliance per physical line.
  - Do not combine operator lines with continuations.
  - Operator-at-end style is preferred.
- **Block-first statement exemption:**
  - Do not require a preceding blank line if the previous meaningful line ends with `{`.

### Examples

#### ✅ Correct (first statement inside a block; no blank line required)

```csharp
public void Foo()
{
    DoSomething(
        x,
        y);
}
```

#### ❌ Incorrect (blank line required between two statements)

```csharp
DoSomething();
DoSomethingElse(
    x,
    y);
```

#### ✅ Correct (wrapped invocation; each line ≤ 120)

```csharp
Validate(
    createException: () => new InvalidDecisionPollException(
        message: "Invalid decisionPoll. Please correct the errors and try again."),
    (Rule: IsInvalid(decisionPoll.Id), Parameter: nameof(DecisionPoll.Id)));
```

#### ❌ Incorrect (single line > 120)

```csharp
Validate(createException: () => new InvalidDecisionPollException(message: "Invalid decisionPoll. Please correct the errors and try again."));
```

---

### Code Formatting Rule Examples

#### ✅ Correct (return with blank line)

```csharp
var user = users.FirstOrDefault(u => u.Id == id);

return user;
```

#### ❌ Incorrect

```csharp
var user = users.FirstOrDefault(u => u.Id == id);
return user;
```

---

### Argument Indentation Examples

#### ✅ Correct

```csharp
DoSomething(
    firstArgument: "value1",
    secondArgument: "value2",
    thirdArgument: "value3");
```

#### ❌ Incorrect (extra indentation)

```csharp
DoSomething(
        firstArgument: "value1",
        secondArgument: "value2",
        thirdArgument: "value3");
```

#### ❌ Incorrect (misaligned closing parenthesis)

```csharp
DoSomething(
    firstArgument: "value1",
    secondArgument: "value2",
    thirdArgument: "value3"
    );
```

---

### More Formatting Examples

#### ✅ Correct

```csharp
var filteredUsers = users
    .Where(u => u.IsActive && u.LastLoginDate >= DateTime.UtcNow.AddDays(-30))
    .OrderByDescending(u => u.LastLoginDate)
    .Select(u => new
    {
        u.Id,
        u.Name,
        u.Email,
        LastSeen = u.LastLoginDate.ToString("yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss")
    })
    .ToList();
```

#### ❌ Incorrect

```csharp
var filteredUsers = users.Where(u => u.IsActive && u.LastLoginDate >= DateTime.UtcNow.AddDays(-30)).OrderByDescending(u => u.LastLoginDate).Select(u => new { u.Id, u.Name, u.Email, LastSeen = u.LastLoginDate.ToString("yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss") }).ToList();
```

### Rationale

- **Per-line measurement** prevents false positives in wrapped calls.
- **Tabs count as 4 characters** ensures consistent line-length calculation.
- **Whitespace-only blank lines count as blank** and match VS behaviour.
- **Return visibility** improves readability.
- **Argument indentation** improves consistency.
- **Block-first patterns** avoid unnecessary whitespace noise.

## Supporting .editorconfig Settings

```ini
[*.{cs,vb,ts,tsx}]
guidelines = 120
indent_style = space
indent_size = 4
trim_trailing_whitespace = true
end_of_line = crlf

dotnet_sort_system_directives_first = true
```
